# YAML Writer Documentation üìù

The `yaml_writer.py` module is part of a larger system designed to handle YAML files effectively. This specific module focuses on writing dictionaries to YAML files in a simple and efficient manner.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `YamlWriter` class is to provide an easy-to-use interface for converting Python dictionaries into YAML format and saving them to a file. This can be particularly useful for configurations, settings, or data that need to be easily shared or stored in a human-readable format.

## Dependencies

To use the `YamlWriter` class, you must have Python and the PyYAML library installed in your environment.

- **Python**: Version 3.x is recommended.
- **PyYAML**: This can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install PyYAML
```

## How to Use

1. **Instantiate the YamlWriter Class**: Provide the path to the output file where the YAML content will be written.

```python
from yaml_writer import YamlWriter

output_path = "path/to/your/output.yaml"
writer = YamlWriter(output_path)
```

2. **Convert and Write Dictionary**: Call the `dict_to_yml` method with the dictionary you wish to convert and write to the file.

```python
output_dict = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "Developer"
}

writer.dict_to_yml(output_dict)
```

## Code Explanation

- **Class YamlWriter**: This class is designed with simplicity in mind. It consists of two main components:
    - **Initializer**: Takes an `output_path` as a parameter, which specifies where the YAML file will be saved.
    - **dict_to_yml Method**: Takes a dictionary (`output_dict`) as input, converts it to YAML format, and writes it to the file specified during the class instantiation.

## Environment Setup

Before deploying the `YamlWriter`, ensure Python and PyYAML are installed and your virtual environment (if used) is activated. The environment setup steps are as follows:

1. Install Python 3.x from the official website.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - **Windows**:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
    - **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install PyYAML:

```bash
pip install PyYAML
```

## Deployment

To deploy the `YamlWriter` in your project:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed as outlined in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) sections.
2. Place the `yaml_writer.py` file in your project directory.
3. Follow the [How to Use](#how-to-use) section to instantiate and use the `YamlWriter` class in your project.

For any further customization or integration into larger systems, modifications to the `YamlWriter` class might be necessary. Ensure to maintain the dependencies and environment configurations as you scale.
